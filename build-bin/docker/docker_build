# Avoid buildx on load for reasons including:
#  * Caching is more complex as builder instances must be considered
#  * It only supports one platform/arch on load https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/59
#  * It would pull Docker Hub for moby/buildkit or multiarch/qemu-user-static images, using up quota
