# This script gets a normalized name for the architecture as used in Docker. This will be a subset
# of ones supported by buildx: https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases. This is a subset because
# for us to support a platform implies also supporting things like running NPM on it, so it should
# be an explicit act to add a platform.
